# Groupomania

This is a full-stack application.
I have built the frontend with React and used Node/Express for the backend

Groupomania is your typical social media platform where users can post, like, and comment. There are two levels of access to this app, one for standard users and one for admins, where admins can create/delete/update users and moderate content.
